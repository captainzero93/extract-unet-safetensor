# UNet Extractor and Remover for Stable Diffusion 1.5 and SDXL

This Python script processes SafeTensors files for Stable Diffusion 1.5 (SD 1.5) and Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) models. It extracts the UNet into a separate file and creates a new file with the remaining model components (without the UNet).

## Why UNet Extraction?

Using UNets instead of full checkpoints can save a significant amount of disk space, especially for models that utilize large text encoders like T5xxl. Here's why:

1. Space Efficiency: Full checkpoints bundle the UNet, CLIP, VAE, and text encoder together. For models using T5xxl, the text encoder alone can be 5-10GB. By extracting the UNet, you can reuse the same text encoder for multiple models, saving 5-10GB per additional model.

2. Flexibility: You can download the text encoder once and use it with multiple UNet models, reducing redundancy and saving space.

3. Practical Example: Two full checkpoints (e.g., nf4 schnell and dev Flux) might take up 22GB. Using extracted UNets instead, the same two models could occupy only 12GB, plus a single 5GB text encoder shared between them.

4. Future-Proofing: As models grow in complexity, the space-saving benefits of using UNets become even more significant.

This tool helps you extract UNets from full checkpoints, allowing you to take advantage of these space-saving benefits.

## Features

- Supports both SD 1.5 and SDXL model architectures
- Extracts UNet tensors from SafeTensors files
- Creates a separate SafeTensors file with non-UNet components
- Saves the extracted UNet as a new SafeTensors file
- Command-line interface for easy use

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- safetensors library

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the `unet_extractor.py` script.

2. Install the required `safetensors` library:

   ```
   pip install safetensors
   ```

## Usage

Run the script from the command line with the following syntax:

```
python unet_extractor.py <input_file> <unet_output_file> <non_unet_output_file> --model_type <sd15|sdxl>
```

### Arguments

- `<input_file>`: Path to the input SafeTensors file (full model)
- `<unet_output_file>`: Path where the extracted UNet will be saved
- `<non_unet_output_file>`: Path where the model without UNet will be saved
- `--model_type`: Specify the model type, either `sd15` for Stable Diffusion 1.5 or `sdxl` for Stable Diffusion XL

### Examples

For Stable Diffusion 1.5:
```
python unet_extractor.py path/to/sd15_model.safetensors path/to/output_sd15_unet.safetensors path/to/output_sd15_non_unet.safetensors --model_type sd15
```

For Stable Diffusion XL:
```
python unet_extractor.py path/to/sdxl_model.safetensors path/to/output_sdxl_unet.safetensors path/to/output_sdxl_non_unet.safetensors --model_type sdxl
```

## How It Works

1. The script opens the input SafeTensors file using the `safetensors` library.
2. It iterates through all tensors in the file, separating UNet-related tensors from other tensors.
3. For SD 1.5, it removes the "model.diffusion_model." prefix from UNet tensor keys.
4. For SDXL, it keeps the original key names for both UNet and non-UNet tensors.
5. The extracted UNet tensors are saved to a new SafeTensors file.
6. The remaining non-UNet tensors are saved to a separate SafeTensors file.

## Notes

- Ensure you have sufficient disk space to save both output files.
- The script processes the tensors in CPU memory, so it should work even on machines without a GPU.
- Processing large models may take some time, depending on your system's performance.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Ensure you have the latest version of the `safetensors` library installed.
2. Check that your input file is a valid SafeTensors file for the specified model type.
3. Make sure you have read permissions for the input file and write permissions for the output directory.
